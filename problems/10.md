# 10 - Chunking and hashing (part 2).

Let's make our client more complete by making it download and verify all
the chunks and saving them to disk.

## Assignment

Server:

- Add the size of the file being shared to the handshake
- Add the chunk-size of the file being shared to the handshake

Client:

- Use the [fs-chunk-store](https://github.com/feross/fs-chunk-store)
  module that we introduced in exercise 8 to save each chunk received in
  the client into a file (tip: use the file-size expose in the handshake
  to initialize the chunk store)

## Testing

1. Run a server that shares a file
1. Have your client connect to the server to download the file
1. Validate the downloaded file
