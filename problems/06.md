# 6 - Hashing files

Now let's expand on our previous, simple hashing exercise and hash the content of a file instead a simple string (this is a file-sharing workshop after all ;).

## Solution of exercise 5

```js
var crypto = require('crypto')

var string = 'Web Rebels 2017'
var hash = crypto.createHash('sha256')

// Add the string to the hash object to encode it
hash.update(string)

// Get the hashed version of the string as a Buffer
var digest = hash.digest()

console.log('%s => %s', string, digest.toString('hex'))
```

## Assignment

Write a program that outputs the hash of a file

## Tips

Use what you've learned about reading files as streams to update the hash object.

Use the `data` event to update the hash, i.e:

```js
fileStream.on('data', function (chunk) {
  // TODO: update the hash with the given chunk
})
```

## Testing

Run the program multiple times and check that the same hash is outputted for the same file and different hashes for different files.
