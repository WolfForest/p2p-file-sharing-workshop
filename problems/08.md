# 8 - Chunking files

Congratulations on getting this far! We've now built a secure file downloading tool that can discover servers running anywhere on the internet sharing the file we're looking for.

However there are still many ways we can improve our program. Right now it's only possible to download the enitre file from a server. This is not very distributed. In p2p systems, it's normal to fetch small parts (called chunks) of the file from different peers at the same time. This distributes the load of downloading.

To do this however we need to change our small program a little bit:

- We'll invent a protocol on top of the raw TCP socket so that the client and server can communicate outside of just sending the actual data
- Using the message protocol we'll allow the client to request only a specific chunk of the file and the server to respond with that chunk

There's a Node module that can read and write the file in fixed size chunks. It's called [fs-chunk-store](https://github.com/feross/fs-chunk-store).

To create the message protocol, let's use the Node module called [msgpack5-stream](https://github.com/watson/msgpack5-stream). Using this moudule, it's really easy to encode complex JavaScript objects into a binary form that we can send over TCP and then decode on the other side as illustrated below.

Client:

```js
var stream = msgpack(socket)   // wrap server TCP socket with msgpack-stream
stream.write({hello: 'world'}) // send JavaScript object over the socket
```

Server:

```js
var stream = msgpack(socket) // wrap client TCP socket with msgpack-stream

// emitted every time a message is received on the socket
stream.on('data', function (obj) {
  console.log(obj) // {hello: 'world'}
})
```

## Pre-assignment

Invent a protocol we can use to both request a chunkÂ of a file and respond with the requested chunk. Feel free to come up with your own protocol, but here's our suggestion for reference:

```js
// requesting chunk
{type: 'request', chunk: <index>}
// responding with chunk
{type: 'response', chunk: <index>, data: <buffer>}
```

## Assignment

Here's a basic server and client that understands msgpack. Your job is to fill in the missing parts indicated by the `TODO` comments.

Server:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var net = require('net')
var DC = require('discovery-channel')
var msgpack = require('msgpack5-stream')
var fsChunkStore = require('fs-chunk-store')

var id = process.argv[2]
var filename = process.argv[3]

if (!id || !filename) {
  console.log('Usage: node server.js [id] [filename]')
  process.exit(1)
}

var CHUNK_SIZE = 1024 // Arbitrary chunk size that fits in memory (not too big, not too small)
var FILE_LENGTH = fs.statSync(filename).size
var file = fsChunkStore(CHUNK_SIZE, {path: filename, length: FILE_LENGTH})
var channel = DC()

var server = net.createServer(function (socket) {
  console.log('New peer connected: %s:%s', socket.remoteAddress, socket.remotePort)

  // Wrap our TCP socket with a msgpack5 protocol wrapper
  var protocol = msgpack(socket)

  protocol.on('data', function (msg) {
    // TODO: Respond to request messages with the requested chunk
  })
})

server.listen(function () {
  channel.join(id, server.address().port)
  console.log('Sharing %s as %s', filename, id)
})
```

Client:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var net = require('net')
var DC = require('discovery-channel')
var msgpack = require('msgpack5-stream')

var id = process.argv[2]
var chunk = process.argv[3]

if (!id || !chunk) {
  console.log('Usage: node client.js [id] [chunk]')
  process.exit(1)
}

var channel = DC()
channel.join(id)

channel.once('peer', function (peerId, peer, type) {
  console.log('New peer %s:%s found via %s', peer.host, peer.port, type)

  var socket = net.connect(peer.port, peer.host)

  // Wrap our TCP socket with a msgpack5 protocol wrapper
  var protocol = msgpack(socket)

  protocol.on('data', function (msg) {
    // For now just output the message we got from the server
    console.log(msg)
  })

  console.log('Fetching chunk %d from %s...', chunk, id)
  // TODO: Send request for `chunk` to server
})
```

## Testing

Use the client to ask the server for a specific chunk:

```
node client.js <channel-id> <chunk-number>
```

Validate that you get different chunks depending on which `<chunk-number>` you request.
