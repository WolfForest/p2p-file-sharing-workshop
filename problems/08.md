# 8 - Chunking files

Congratulations on getting this far! We've now built a secure file downloading tool that can discover servers running anywhere on the internet sharing the file we're looking for.

However there are still many ways we can improve our program. Right now it's only possible to download the enitre file from a server. This is not very distributed. In p2p systems, it's normal to fetch small parts (called chunks) of the file from different peers at the same time. This distributes the load of downloading.

To do this however we need to change our small program a little bit:

- We'll invent a protocol on top of the raw TCP socket so that the client and server can communicate outside of just sending the actual data
- Using the message protocol we'll allow the client to request only a specific chunk of the file and the server to respond with that chunk

There's a Node module that can read and write the file in fixed size chunks. It's called [fs-chunk-store](https://github.com/feross/fs-chunk-store).

To create the message protocol, let's use the Node module called [msgpack5-stream](https://github.com/watson/msgpack5-stream).

## Assignment

Here's a basic server that understands msgpack. Your job is to fill in the missing parts indicated by the `TODO` comments.

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var net = require('net')
var DC = require('discovery-channel')
var msgpack = require('msgpack5-stream')
var fsChunkStore = require('fs-chunk-store')

var id = process.argv[2]
var filename = process.argv[3]

if (!id || !filename) {
  console.log('Usage: node server.js [id] [filename]')
  process.exit(1)
}

var CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
var FILE_LENGTH = fs.statSync(filename).size
var file = fsChunkStore(CHUNK_SIZE, {path: filename, length: FILE_LENGTH})
var channel = DC()

var server = net.createServer(function (socket) {
  console.log('New peer connected: %s:%s', socket.remoteAddress, socket.remotePort)

  // Wrap our TCP socket with a msgpack5 protocol wrapper
  var protocol = msgpack(socket)

  protocol.on('data', function (msg) {
    // TODO: If the message type is `request`, respond with the requested chunk
    // The response should look like {type: 'response', chunk: chunkNumber, data: chunkData}
  })
})

server.listen(function () {
  channel.join(id, server.address().port)
  console.log('Sharing %s as %s', filename, id)
})
```

## Testing

Here's a client that also uses msgpack that you can use to test your server. It will just output the returned message.

Here's how to run it:

```
node client.js <channel-id> <chunk-number>
```

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var net = require('net')
var DC = require('discovery-channel')
var msgpack = require('msgpack5-stream')

var id = process.argv[2]
var chunk = process.argv[3]

if (!id || !chunk) {
  console.log('Usage: node client.js [id] [chunk]')
  process.exit(1)
}

var channel = DC()
channel.join(id)

channel.once('peer', function (peerId, peer, type) {
  console.log('New peer %s:%s found via %s', peer.host, peer.port, type)

  var socket = net.connect(peer.port, peer.host)

  // Wrap our TCP socket with a msgpack5 protocol wrapper
  var protocol = msgpack(socket)

  protocol.on('data', function (msg) {
    // For now just output the message we got from the server
    console.log(msg)
  })

  console.log('Fetching chunk %d from %s...', chunk, id)
  protocol.write({type: 'request', chunk: chunk})
})
```
