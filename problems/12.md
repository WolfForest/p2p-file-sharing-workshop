# 12 - On demand streaming

Most video or audio playing software (like
[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)) have a way to stream
content from an HTTP server using range requests. Let's create a bridge
that exposes our application as an HTTP endpoint.

## Tips

Make sure the bridge supports the HTTP `Range` header.

When an HTTP client wants only part of a file being served by the
server, it can set the `Range` header to indicate which bytes it wants
to fetch:

```
Range: bytes=500-999
```

Use the [range-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/range-parser)
module to make this easy.

Here's some files to get started:

- Use the same server as from exercise 11
  ([solutions/12/server.js](../solutions/12/server.js))
- We'll modify the client from exercise 11 slightly by exposing it as an
  API so our HTTP server can use it programatically
  ([solutions/12/client.js](../solutions/12/client.js))
  - `client.getHandshake(callback)` - The callback will be called with
    an optional error object as the first argument and an object as the
    2nd: `{type: 'handshake', mimeTyoe: '...', hashses: [...], chunkSize:
    ..., fileSize: ...}`
  - `client.getData(index, callback)` - The `index` argument is the
    chunk number. The callback will be called with an optional error
    object as the first argument and the chunk as the 2nd

## Assignment

- Create a priority queue so certain chunks get served first (as they
  are needed when scrubbing)
- Create an HTTP server that bridges the p2p application

## Tests

Share a video file using the server and see if you can play it in VLC by
connecting to the bridge.

## What's next?

If you get this far, here's a few ideas for how to expand your p2p
program:

- Make it work in the browser
- Live streaming
