# 5 - Hashing

In the previous exercise you created a simple file-downloader that automatically discoveres servers to download the file from. But it has a serious security problem: What if the server is a bad actor and wants to send you malicious data?

This exercise introduces you to a concept called hashing that we can later use to validate that the data we're getting has not been compromised.

Hashing is essentially a way to create a small fingerprint representing a large chunk of data. Many different hashing algorithms exists, but in this workshop we'll just use one called `sha256`.

## Assignment

Write a program that prints out the `sha256` hash of the string 'NodeConf EU 2016'.

## Tips

When working with hashing in Node.js, we use the [crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) module from Node core. Use the method [`createHash()`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createhash_algorithm).

```js
var crypto = require('crypto')

var hash = crypto.createHash('sha256')
//...
```

## Tests

Hash the string `NodeConf EU 2016` and verify that the hex value of the hash is `ac5a6afc8c8d15da64cd9931fd5a4ba4e716c9b5679d4d57289022a72b1fcd14`
